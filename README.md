### PHPServerMonitor

[PHPServerMonitor](http://www.phpservermonitor.org/) is a script that checks whether your websites and servers are up and running. It comes with a web based user interface where you can manage your services and websites, and you can manage users for each server with a mobile number and email address.

### Docker Compose

First create a local file named `config.php` and chown it to www-data `chown 33:33 config.php`

```docker-compose up -d```

http://ip

#### crontab config

Default: 5 minutes and 10 seconds

Edit file ```crontab```:

```*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /var/www/html/cron/status.cron.php --timeout=310```

#### Database configuration


If you used my docker-compose.yml file you have to : 

1. Go on phpmyadmin : http://ip_of_your_server:81  (If you don't want to use phpmyadmin for security reasons you can just delete the container in my docker-compose.yml file and create your database with the command line from the container MySQL.)
2. Create a database : monitor (you can use another name)
3. Go on PhpServerMonitor : http://ip_of_your_server
